3537	A Chinese citizen has been arrested in connection with the Jan.1 arson attack at the Chinese Consulate in San Francisco.	encn_shizheng.txt
3538	All the voices he had been hearing were in Chinese, and the Chinese Consulate had to have been involved.	encn_shizheng.txt
3539	Other nations generate pollution too, of course, so the wafting of bad air from China adds to local problems.	encn_shizheng.txt
3540	The countries most directly affected by air pollution from China are its nearest neighbors.	encn_shizheng.txt

3577	For now, China’s bitcoin miners can continue excavating their digital ore.	encn_shizheng.txt
3578	The global impact of China’s demise as a bitcoin hub is not straightforward.	encn_shizheng.txt
3579	What’s more, if Chinese miners are forced to the sidelines, there will be more room for others.	encn_shizheng.txt
3580	The ban in China may also ease the currency’s governance problems.	encn_shizheng.txt
3581	It weakens the influence of Chinese miners, who have clashed with Western bitcoin developers.	encn_shizheng.txt
3582	A bigger threat is that other countries follow China’s lead.	encn_shizheng.txt
3583	China, in other words, might still be at the vanguard of the crypto currency world.	encn_shizheng.txt
3584	China’s craze for bike-sharing has brought more than 2m new bikes to its city streets.	encn_shizheng.txt

3594	Laos as a nation was of course created out of the French colonial period.	encn_shizheng.txt
3595	Laos was seen as separate from Vietnam and Cambodia as well as claiming independence from France.	encn_shizheng.txt
3596	As the Communist period developed, Laos was very close with Vietnam.	encn_shizheng.txt
3597	The Pathet Lao, backed by the Vietnamese Communists, basically sought to move Laos into a Communist sphere of influence.	encn_shizheng.txt
3598	I think Laos in fact tries to maintain connections with all of the different powers.	encn_shizheng.txt
3599	I think Laos would be interested in what a role of US in Southeast Asia could look like.	encn_shizheng.txt
3600	What are the key debates in Laos over how to manage its natural resources?	encn_shizheng.txt
3601	Something like 40 percent of all Laos's exports are in minerals, and 30 percent of that is copper alone.	encn_shizheng.txt
3602	So the two largest investments in gold and copper mines are pretty strategic areas of interest for Laos.	encn_shizheng.txt
3603	In December 2015, Laos lifted its moratorium on their mining concessions.	encn_shizheng.txt
3604	Are Laos's critics right when they say the human rights situation in the country is deteriorating?	encn_shizheng.txt
3605	While much of the president's trip was devoted to the future, he spent time in Laos confronting America's wartime past.	encn_shizheng.txt
3606	For the people of Laos, the war did not end when the bombs stopped falling.	encn_shizheng.txt
3607	So for the last four decades, Laotians have continued to live under the shadow of war.	encn_shizheng.txt

3617	In the past week, any semblance of a friendship between Mr. Trump and Clinton came to an ugly end.	encn_shizheng.txt
3618	But Mr. Trump's attacks on him are now rippling through the race.	encn_shizheng.txt

3620	Mr. Trump has said that when elected as president he would rip up international trade deals.	encn_shizheng.txt
3621	Mr. Trump is proposing a reordering of the global economic system that would fundamentally reshape the structure of American industry.	encn_shizheng.txt
3622	The easiest promise for Mr. Trump to deliver is the one to renegotiate or leave Nafta.	encn_shizheng.txt
3623	Similar escape hatches would also allow Mr. Trump to withdraw the United States from free trade agreements with other nations.	encn_shizheng.txt
3624	If Mr. Trump became president, he would have the power to create a more isolated American economy.	encn_shizheng.txt
3625	It's a prospect that scares many economists, but appears not to worry Mr. Trump.	encn_shizheng.txt
3626	But her allies fear that additional emails might come out and provide more fodder for Mr. Trump.	encn_shizheng.txt
3627	As part of the Trump trade, the US currency rose sharply in the weeks following his election.	encn_shizheng.txt
3628	Trump may ultimately do the work for her, his bluster, lies and insults could eventually drag him down.	encn_shizheng.txt
3629	Eventually, Mr. Trump's aides convinced him that he had to make the trip.	encn_shizheng.txt
3630	On Tuesday night, he reiterated his deep distaste for Mr. Trump.	encn_shizheng.txt

3634	The probe into alleged collusion between Moscow and the Trump election campaign was highly significant.	encn_shizheng.txt
3635	The dissenters are loudly and publicly proclaiming their unwillingness to support Mr. Trump.	encn_shizheng.txt
3636	These reports threw a spotlight on a glaring vulnerability for Trump, his admiration for President Vladimir Putin of Russia.	encn_shizheng.txt
3637	In an interview, Mr. Trump asked a reporter how Mr. Lo's show had turned out, then answered his question.	encn_shizheng.txt
3638	Trump's views on trade are among his oldest and steadiest public policy positions.	encn_shizheng.txt
3639	The exchange rate dropped somewhat this week after Mr Trump’s comments.	encn_shizheng.txt
3640	Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, had grown increasingly concerned after a New York Times article published on Sunday.	encn_shizheng.txt
3641	In part, Trump's endurance is a product of sheer churn, the endless stream of his own provocations.	encn_shizheng.txt
3642	With such a ferocious pace, it is easy to lose sight of the details, especially when it comes to Trump.	encn_shizheng.txt
3643	It is welcome that Mr. Trump is now open to reappointing Ms. Yellen as Fed chair.	encn_shizheng.txt
3644	Can does any story, or revelation hurt Trump's teflon qualities at this stage?	encn_shizheng.txt
3645	The servant put the fish in front of Donald and I took my chopsticks and began to pick at it.	encn_shizheng.txt
3646	The bottom line, some experts say, is that Trump might well be able to squeeze China.	encn_shizheng.txt
3647	Hillary holds a wide lead over Trump in a new national poll that came out shortly.	encn_shizheng.txt
3648	There have been new accounts of widespread discrimination against black people at Trump's New York properties during the 1970s.	encn_shizheng.txt

3651	Trump has promised to do quite a few things that are beyond the powers of an American president.	encn_shizheng.txt
3652	It is always pleasing when Mr. Trump manages to hit upon a sensible policy.	encn_shizheng.txt

3679	He swore he would name China as a manipulator on his first day in office.	encn_shizheng.txt
3680	He mocked supporters of Mr. Trump, who he said have taunted him for some time.	encn_shizheng.txt

3683	Mr. Sasse answered those who asked if Mr. Trump's decisive victory in Indiana on Tuesday changes anything for me.	encn_shizheng.txt
3684	As president, Trump would have some latitude to reverse a course that the nation has pursued for decades.	encn_shizheng.txt
3685	But for weeks, Trump seemed to be working off some kind of Sontag-inspired playbook.	encn_shizheng.txt
3686	Nonetheless, Mr. Trump's litigation over Riverside South dragged on for at least four years.	encn_shizheng.txt
3687	The attorney general of New York has started an investigation into the Donald Trump Foundation.	encn_shizheng.txt
3688	You let them know that Trump has great respect for them, okay?	encn_shizheng.txt
3689	After the lawsuit, the Hong Kong partners moved swiftly to cut all ties to Mr. Trump.	encn_shizheng.txt

3704	The easiest way for Trump to sidestep the whole Ukraine story is for Manafort not to be there.	encn_shizheng.txt
3705	As president, Trump could seek to penalize other nations for undercutting American manufacturers or stealing American ideas.	encn_shizheng.txt

3709	When it comes to Trump, though, his enduring popularity is a mystery.	encn_shizheng.txt
3710	But today, Mr. Trump counts that legal defeat as a victory.	encn_shizheng.txt

3722	Instead Mr. Trump put the US at the head of the Sunni Arab coalition against Iran.	encn_shizheng.txt
3723	He also suggested that Mr Mueller was likely ,to examine whether Mr Trump’s remarks were an attempt to obstruct justice.	encn_shizheng.txt

4455	I even stopped walking the dog, which I have always done.	encn_tiyu.txt
4456	I just felt as though everyone was looking at me when I was out.	encn_tiyu.txt
4457	I just wanted to stay in the house, lock the door, shut the gate and not let anyone in.	encn_tiyu.txt
4458	I was in this different place and it is not a nice place to be.	encn_tiyu.txt
4459	In 2012, however, the goalkeeper signed for Championship side Sheffield Wednesday.	encn_tiyu.txt
4460	It was after that move Kirkland says his anxiety began to take hold.	encn_tiyu.txt
4461	I started to struggle with anxiety when I was travelling over to Sheffield Wednesday.	encn_tiyu.txt
4462	When I was away from the house, I started to panic and started to struggle.	encn_tiyu.txt
4463	Looking back now, it was hard to do it, but you just do.	encn_tiyu.txt
4464	I just told them I needed to be closer to home.	encn_tiyu.txt
4465	I think Andy Rhodes knew, but the club were just a little bit unsure.	encn_tiyu.txt
4466	They told me to take my time and to give it a couple of weeks.	encn_tiyu.txt
4467	I just wanted to be in the house and shut the door.	encn_tiyu.txt
4468	I couldn't wait to get to sleep at night to have a little bit of clear mind.	encn_tiyu.txt
4469	But when I woke up in the morning, it all started again.	encn_tiyu.txt
4470	Then obviously staying over before matches, which I tried to limit as much as I could.	encn_tiyu.txt
4471	But getting home on Fridays, everyone knows the traffic on Fridays is a nightmare.	encn_tiyu.txt
4472	It sounds silly but everything is blown up out of proportion because you are not thinking rationally.	encn_tiyu.txt
4473	Worrying about everything - 'when am I going to get a day off so I can get home'.	encn_tiyu.txt
4474	Without Andy Rhodes I would have walked - I did initially.	encn_tiyu.txt
4475	I signed at the back end of the 2012 season, so I had all June before pre-season.	encn_tiyu.txt
4476	I rang Andy and said I had to sort one or two things out at home.	encn_tiyu.txt
4477	But then I went back and they bent over backwards for me.	encn_tiyu.txt
4478	The way I was, I was in a bad, bad place.	encn_tiyu.txt
4479	I started thinking how far was I from where Gary Speed was?	encn_tiyu.txt
4480	But I don't think that means I wanted to do anything.	encn_tiyu.txt
4481	It just means when I was asleep that was the only time.	encn_tiyu.txt
4482	Getting to sleep was a problem but when I got to sleep you are dozing away.	encn_tiyu.txt
4483	So when did Kirkland begin to realise he had to do something about his anxiety?	encn_tiyu.txt
4484	It was when we lost a dear friend of the family, Callum.	encn_tiyu.txt
4485	He had a blood clot on his leg and it all progressed from there.	encn_tiyu.txt
4486	I never got chance to say goodbye to him, which was hard.	encn_tiyu.txt
4487	I didn't realise just how good a friend he was until he was gone.	encn_tiyu.txt
4488	Things came to a head when the club were away in Portugal for pre-season.	encn_tiyu.txt
4489	I wanted to give it a go so I went back.	encn_tiyu.txt
4490	After the third day, I have said it, we were in a little five-a-side and I just wasn't there.	encn_tiyu.txt
4491	I went in and said I need a break, I need to get away.	encn_tiyu.txt
4492	It is still an ongoing process but I can see light now.	encn_tiyu.txt
4493	Whether it is to the PFA or someone at your club.	encn_tiyu.txt
4494	We are here to try and get more people into clubs to help players.	encn_tiyu.txt
4495	There are a lot of players, that is why we are doing it.	encn_tiyu.txt
4496	I am sure there is a lot we don't know about as well.	encn_tiyu.txt
4497	You have got to talk because we have seen what can happen unfortunately, with people taking their own lives.	encn_tiyu.txt
4498	Before, 10 or 15 years ago, I used to think ,how can you do that to your family?	encn_tiyu.txt
4499	After what I have gone through, I can see how it leads to that road and it is scary.	encn_tiyu.txt
4500	Once I started talking things seemed a lot clearer'It's ok to talk, don't be ashamed, don't be embarrassed.	encn_tiyu.txt
4501	You'll always get some people who mock you but those people are cowards and should be ashamed of themselves.	encn_tiyu.txt
4502	Once I started talking things seemed a lot clearer and there are people there who will help you.	encn_tiyu.txt
4503	I think football realised they have a massive problem on their hands.	encn_tiyu.txt
4504	But now they are putting measures in place to make sure the help is there for players.	encn_tiyu.txt
4505	Having seen the positive reaction Kirkland has had to his own story, does he wish he had spoken out sooner?	encn_tiyu.txt
4506	But you are not thinking straight, your mind is not your own.	encn_tiyu.txt
4507	But until it does click in, you are not functioning right at all.	encn_tiyu.txt
4508	Messi then set up Lucas Digne for a third before Nikolaou's fine header grabbed a late consolation.	encn_tiyu.txt
4509	Pique had been shown a second yellow for a handball just before the break.	encn_tiyu.txt
4510	He protested his innocence to Scottish referee Willie Collum but rightly received his first Champions League red card.	encn_tiyu.txt
4511	Messi becomes only the second player after Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo to reach three figures in European competition.	encn_tiyu.txt
4512	I believe in these players and we're capable of changing the group situation around," coach Diego Simeone said."	encn_tiyu.txt
4513	The result means Juve are three points behind Group D leaders Barcelona, who have nine points from three games.	encn_tiyu.txt
4514	The Swiss side are a point behind leaders Manchester United in Group A.	encn_tiyu.txt
4515	Boston Celtics' $128m forward Gordon Hayward fractured his ankle in their NBA season opener against Cleveland Cavaliers.	encn_tiyu.txt
4516	Hayward joined the Celtics in July in a deal worth $128m (£97m).	encn_tiyu.txt
4517	Elsewhere, defending champions Golden State Warriors lost 122-121 to Houston Rockets, with James Harden top-scoring with 27 points.	encn_tiyu.txt
4518	The former Edinburgh and Gloucester scrum-half was injured in his side's weekend Champions Cup win over Ospreys.	encn_tiyu.txt
4519	Laidlaw will be unavailable for Scotland's home matches against Samoa, New Zealand and Australia next month.	encn_tiyu.txt
4520	Stand-in skipper John Barclay could also miss out as he continues to battle against an ongoing concussion issue.	encn_tiyu.txt
4521	Scarlets back-row Barclay is still undergoing Head Injury Assessment (HIA) protocols.	encn_tiyu.txt
4522	The United States Grand Prix could be the race at which Lewis Hamilton wins his fourth world title.	encn_tiyu.txt
4523	Cota, as they call it, is a rare new track in F1 where the architects have got things absolutely right.	encn_tiyu.txt
4524	Ask anyone in F1 what are their favourite races and you can guarantee that Austin is right up there.	encn_tiyu.txt
4525	Only this time, as their team batting average in the ALCS lingers well below.	encn_tiyu.txt
4526	The first, in the division series against Cleveland, vanquished a 102-win team.	encn_tiyu.txt
4527	"I'm not sure what would have happened had we not went through that experience."	encn_tiyu.txt
4528	Well, they wouldn't be here for one, and they wouldn't have experienced the multi-level vengeance Game 5 gifted them.	encn_tiyu.txt
4529	To say Astros starter Dallas Keuchel had owned the Yankees over his career would be an understatement.	encn_tiyu.txt
4530	He knocked New York out of the playoffs in the wild-card game two years back.	encn_tiyu.txt
4531	In Game 1 of this ALCS, he shut them out over seven innings.	encn_tiyu.txt
4532	That's 22 hits over five games for baseball's most potent offense.	encn_tiyu.txt
4533	Like Tanaka, Sanchez was once doubted, down in the minor leagues, when his prospect status dimmed amid work-ethic concerns.	encn_tiyu.txt
4534	And Judge, the Rookie of the Year-to-be, entered the season a question mark following a dreadful 2016 debut.	encn_tiyu.txt
4535	There are others, too, up and down the roster, giving this Yankees team some – gulp – charm.	encn_tiyu.txt
4536	As difficult a matchup as Game 5 was thought to be, Game 6 should be even harder.	encn_tiyu.txt
4537	The league wants its players to stand for the national anthem.	encn_tiyu.txt
4538	However, it appears there will be no rule passed to force that issue.	encn_tiyu.txt
4539	The fact is, we have about a half a dozen players that are protesting," Goodell said.	encn_tiyu.txt
4540	"We hope and we're going to continue to work to try to put that at zero.	encn_tiyu.txt
4541	But we want to make sure we're understanding what the players are talking about, and that's complex."	encn_tiyu.txt
4542	Vikings players link arms during the national anthem before their game against the Lions on Oct.1 in Minneapolis.	encn_tiyu.txt
4543	Goodell was asked why the NFL wouldn't make it a rule to stand.	encn_tiyu.txt
4544	That's an important part of our game and our moments, and we believe in that," Goodell said.	encn_tiyu.txt
4545	We have about six or seven players involved in this protest at this point.	encn_tiyu.txt
4546	That is really what's ultimately going to be the important aspect for us long term.	encn_tiyu.txt
4547	Goodell was also asked about the latest tweet from President Donald Trumpabout the NFL.	encn_tiyu.txt
4548	The NFL has decided that it will not force players to stand for the playing of our National Anthem.	encn_tiyu.txt
4549	Goodell said he has not talked to Trump about the anthem issue."	encn_tiyu.txt
4550	We respect our country, respect our flag, respect our national anthem," Goodell said.	encn_tiyu.txt
4551	Many players probably wouldn't react well to being told to stand.	encn_tiyu.txt
4552	What we're trying to do is stay out of politics," Goodell said.	encn_tiyu.txt
4553	What we're looking to do is continue to get people focused on football."	encn_tiyu.txt
4554	Another issue that was asked about was what happens if an owner punishes a player who kneels for the anthem.	encn_tiyu.txt
4555	Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones recently made non-specific threats about players who don't stand for the anthem."	encn_tiyu.txt
4556	The owners demonstrated their single-minded ruthlessness, especially when the thought of Championship football strayed into their consciousness.	encn_tiyu.txt
4557	No shock to the system given their track record and treatment of the Italian.	encn_tiyu.txt
4558	Shakespeare was forced to defend his players, and possibly himself, when Ranieri said.	encn_tiyu.txt
4559	I had a little problem the year before and we won the title.	encn_tiyu.txt
4560	Maybe this year, when we lose, those people push a little more."	encn_tiyu.txt
4561	Walsh explained the approach when he told BBC Radio 5 Live.	encn_tiyu.txt
4562	If you just needed to get all the best players, scouting would be easy, wouldn't it?	encn_tiyu.txt
4563	You've got to look at the players maybe through different eyes and see what they can achieve.	encn_tiyu.txt
4564	For me, it's not just about their ability on the ball.	encn_tiyu.txt
4565	It's what they're prepared to give to the team when they haven't got it."	encn_tiyu.txt
4566	Vardy was the pacy threat of old, Mahrez the mercurial maverick, and normal solid service was restored in Leicester's defence.	encn_tiyu.txt
4567	Leicester finished in a comfortable 12th position, 10 points off relegation, but Ranieri's success left Shakespeare holding a poisoned chalice.	encn_tiyu.txt
4568	While no-one seriously expected a repeat of 2015-16, expectations were rightly raised.	encn_tiyu.txt
4569	The bar he set for any successor will always be too high.	encn_tiyu.txt
4570	Kante did exactly that, and his move to Chelsea yielded a second title in two years.	encn_tiyu.txt
4571	It was a twist of fate that was none of Shakespeare's doing, and one mitigating factor in his failure.	encn_tiyu.txt
4572	Without Silva and, now, without the manager who attempted to sign him, Leicester find themselves in further reduced circumstances.	encn_tiyu.txt
4573	When Antonio Conte was appointed manager of Juventus, he explained his philosophy as follows.	encn_tiyu.txt
4574	Not just cover every blade, but gobble it up as if they were dots in the Pac-Man game.	encn_tiyu.txt
4575	He wished to build a team in the image of the player he was for the Old Lady.	encn_tiyu.txt
4576	That player was Radja Nainggolan, the Ninja, although his nickname is only partly down to his ability to elude Conte.	encn_tiyu.txt
4577	The past 18 months have been the best of Nainggolan's career.	encn_tiyu.txt
4578	Already a fixture in the Serie A Team of the Year since 2015, he has reached new heights.	encn_tiyu.txt
4579	From a rampaging bite-your-legs midfielder, Nainggolan has evolved into something more.	encn_tiyu.txt
4580	"A Gattuso who scores goals," wrote La Repubblica's venerable columnist, Gianni Mura.	encn_tiyu.txt
4581	From spring 2016 to the end of last season, he hit 20 goals from midfield.	encn_tiyu.txt
4582	It meant Belgium's rough diamond played further up the pitch in a role, you'd usually associate with a number 10.	encn_tiyu.txt
4583	Spalletti's genius came in recognising the value of having a ball-winner of Nainggolan's predatory instincts so close to goal.	encn_tiyu.txt
4584	"I'm convinced that if you had 10 Nainggolans, you'd have a great team because the position he plays doesn't matter."	encn_tiyu.txt
4585	Asked how much the 29-year-old might be worth, Spalletti had no doubts.	encn_tiyu.txt
4586	And besides "there's always something", such as the fact Nainggolan smokes and isn't ashamed of it.	encn_tiyu.txt
4587	"I've got no desire to be at home like everybody else - work-home, work-home, work-home."	encn_tiyu.txt
4588	To earn a call up, you have to play regularly for your club.	encn_tiyu.txt
4589	Unless you're Youri Tielemans, who has started just twice for Monaco.	encn_tiyu.txt
4590	But not if you're Axel Witsel, who left Russia for China.	encn_tiyu.txt
4591	People thought I was inferior to the others who ended up not making it.	encn_tiyu.txt
4592	The Italians accepted me very quickly and I will never forget that.	encn_tiyu.txt
4593	His Indonesian father walked out on his mother and twin sister Riana when he was still a boy.	encn_tiyu.txt
4594	Lizy, his mother, had to hold down two jobs to put food on the table.	encn_tiyu.txt
4595	After meeting his wife, a Sardinian, while playing for Cagliari, Rome is now home for the Nainggolans.	encn_tiyu.txt
4596	And when they do, Roma will party, having not won it since 2000-01.	encn_tiyu.txt
4597	"A title in Rome is worth 10 in Milan or Turin."	encn_tiyu.txt
4598	Furthermore, the name of Tyrrell Hatton must now be heavily pencilled in to European skipper Thomas Bjorn's prospective team.	encn_tiyu.txt
4599	He has landed back-to-back titles with victories in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship and then the lucrative Italian Open.	encn_tiyu.txt
4600	"For any European, the goal is to play a Ryder Cup," Hatton said after a superb final-round 65 in Italy.	encn_tiyu.txt
4601	There have now been seven qualifying events, which is still very early in the phony war period.	encn_tiyu.txt
4602	The 26-year-old from High Wycombe, though, already holds a commanding lead, sitting more than 1.	encn_tiyu.txt
4603	3 million points ahead of Marc Warren, who is fifth in the European Points List.	encn_tiyu.txt
4604	Neither would be among the favourites to last the qualifying course, but at this stage, Bjorn will not be complaining.	encn_tiyu.txt
4605	Other victors such as Matthew Fitzpatrick and Paul Dunne, like Hatton, are genuine contenders for the team.	encn_tiyu.txt
4606	This had no material effect on where his players hit their ball, but his uncertainty as a leader was exposed.	encn_tiyu.txt
4607	It was ultimately reflected in a disjointed European display and defeat on the course.	encn_tiyu.txt
4608	Former Tournament Committee chairman Bjorn has been Europe's pre-eminent golfing politician over the past decade.	encn_tiyu.txt
4609	This is why he has made the smart move of weighting qualifying points.	encn_tiyu.txt
4610	Those earned after May 24 next year will be multiplied by 1.5,	encn_tiyu.txt
4611	to favour those in the best form as the Ryder Cup approaches.	encn_tiyu.txt
4612	Even so, it would seem Hatton will now take some dislodging from the European line up.	encn_tiyu.txt
4613	Hatton has made very few of those in the past couple of weeks.	encn_tiyu.txt
4614	But he is showing his golf is plenty good enough to come through it.	encn_tiyu.txt
4615	"Wim Fissette and I have mutually decided to end our working relationship," she said on Wednesday.	encn_tiyu.txt
4616	"My foot is improving but it is still advisable to rest it further."	encn_tiyu.txt
4617	Things ended very amicably and I wish Wim all the best.	encn_tiyu.txt
4618	We've achieved a lot together and I want to thank him for all his patience, hard work and expertise.	encn_tiyu.txt
4619	That team owners had a point to make and they made it.	encn_tiyu.txt
4620	He noted on Tuesday that teams have used a variety of dodges to explain why Kaepernick isn't on a team.	encn_tiyu.txt
4621	It's not this system, this system doesn't work for him. These quarterbacks are terrible in any system.	encn_tiyu.txt
4622	However, he added, there has been no such directive from the Seattle front office to stand for the anthem.	encn_tiyu.txt
4623	We got, as the politicians would say, a very liberal team ownership.	encn_tiyu.txt
4624	But the 27-year-old now looks set to miss the rest of the season after fracturing his left tibia.	encn_tiyu.txt
4625	Hayward was taken away in an air cast shortly after James came over to console him.	encn_tiyu.txt
4626	Do the Cops Need a Warrant to Snoop from their Drones?	encn_tiyu.txt
4627	Hope for a speedy recovery, a healthy recovery, James said, as quoted by the Associated Press.	encn_tiyu.txt
4628	Trump is a soulless coward, says Popovich in scathing attack on the president. Don't miss.	encn_tiyu.txt
4629	George suffered a compound fracture, the bone piercing through the skin.	encn_tiyu.txt
4630	His recovery took eight months and saw him miss 76 games.	encn_tiyu.txt
4631	Less than two years after the fracture, George was posting a career high in points, averaging 23.3 per game.	encn_tiyu.txt
4632	I felt I was immortal, George said in January 2015, as quoted by Sporting News.	encn_tiyu.txt
4633	I've made so many plays where guys go down, and I walked up clean from it.	encn_tiyu.txt
4634	I did feel that nothing bad could ever happen to me on the court.	encn_tiyu.txt
4635	As soon as the air hit my bone, where the open wound was, it just shot through my whole body.	encn_tiyu.txt
4636	Although the injuries are different, Hayward can look to George's rejuvenation for inspiration in the months ahead.	encn_tiyu.txt
4637	The sport will make its Paralympic debut at Tokyo 2020 and GB Taekwondo's podium plans are already taking shape.	encn_tiyu.txt
4638	Even we have been shocked by their progress, Walkden told BBC Sport.	encn_tiyu.txt
4639	It's been amazing trying a new sport which still involves kicking and I love fighting.	encn_tiyu.txt
4640	It shows what can be achieved with these facilities, which are the best in the world, Lane told BBC Sport.	encn_tiyu.txt
4641	Lane believes people will love watching the fights, adding that it's absolute war out there.	encn_tiyu.txt
4642	The team are also guided by former able-bodied European champion Andrew Deer.	encn_tiyu.txt
4643	But the funding body said it required additional time to analyse Britain's true medal prospects at the Tokyo Games.	encn_tiyu.txt
4644	All the guys in the locker room will give me a hard time and call me Robin Thicke or call me Justin Bieber.	encn_tiyu.txt
4645	Although the forward showers several times a day, he only washes his hair with shampoo and conditioner a few times a week.	encn_tiyu.txt
4646	He uses a combination of two products from Paul Mitchell -- a serum and a cream -- to mold it into his signature shape.	encn_tiyu.txt
4647	He changes the products he uses every few months so his skin doesn't become used to them, a tactic dermatologists often recommend.	encn_tiyu.txt
4648	Two of Mr. Butler's teammates, Roy Hibbert and George Hill, are fans of the Shea Souffle moisturizer from a brand called Carol's Daughter.	encn_tiyu.txt

4652	About 80 workers at one of Qatar’s most prestigious development projects have not been paid in 18 months, and they are starving.	encn_tiyu.txt
4653	The dormitories in which South Asian laborers are housed are squalid and unhygienic, often packed with a dozen workers per room.	encn_tiyu.txt
4654	They only have the contract ripped up before their eyes as they are handed a second contract with big reductions in wages.	encn_tiyu.txt
4655	FIFA has been conspicuously mute about the mistreatment of workers in Qatar, only recently calling the emirate’s labor practices “unacceptable”.	encn_tiyu.txt
4656	Fortunately for soccer fans, there is still time to pressure Qatar to reform its legal regime and improve its treatment of migrant workers.	encn_tiyu.txt
4657	A logical place to start would be to abolish the kafala system and to allow the free movement of labor within the country.	encn_tiyu.txt

4663	When parental sports spending goes up, it increases the likelihood either that the child will feel pressure or that the parent will exert it.	encn_tiyu.txt
4664	The study adds to a small but growing body of research suggesting that parents ought to temper their investments in youth athletics.	encn_tiyu.txt
4665	This finding is likely to baffle parents who view Tiger Woods and the Williams sisters as star-studded products of heavy parental investment.	encn_tiyu.txt
4666	At least in sporting arenas, the so-called tiger style of parenting that spares no expense in the pursuit of top-notch results.	encn_tiyu.txt
4667	A parent in the stands can help a child feel proud about doing well, as well as withstand the disappointments inherent in competition.	encn_tiyu.txt
4668	Greater parental spending tends to weaken a child's sense of ownership of his athletic career, sometimes destroying his will to succeed.	encn_tiyu.txt
